void acb_norm(arb_t mod, const acb_t x, const slong prec)

   Sets a real value mod to the norm of x, a complex number, i.e. mod = norm(x).
   mod is short for the modulus(complex C) as commonly used in mathematics.

int acb_set_str(acb_t res, const char * inp, slong prec)`

   Sets a complex res number from string input inp. As in the arb_set_str() function
   the human-readable string can have decimal floating-point literals, such as "25",
   "0.001" "1.0 +/- 2.3e-10" or may include up to four literals separated by the
   symbol "+/-". Braces may also be included, such as "[3.14159265358979 +/- 1.3e-14]"

   BUT a caveat applies:

   Caveat: The real and imaginary parts of the number MUST be separated by a space character.
            If only one number is given, it is automatically assumed to be real with imag set
            to zero.


long autoset_bin_prec(const char* inp)

    Takes a string input, finds a complex number from that, parses the real and imag parts and
    determines the bit precision needed for the part which has most precision (digits).
    This is intended to be a utility function for auto-setting the slong prec variable used in
    many arb and acb functions to specify bit precision.

void acb_set_ui_ui(acb_t z, ulong x, ulong y)

    Sets z such that the real part of z = x, and the imag part of z = y.
